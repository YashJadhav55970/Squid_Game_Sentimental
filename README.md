Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze the sentiments of viewers towards the Netflix series "Squid Game" using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 
Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions expressed in text data as positive, negative, or neutral. 
In this case, the analysis focuses on understanding how viewers perceive and react to different aspects of the series, such as its plot, characters, themes, and overall impact.

Components of the Project:
1. Data Collection: Obtain textual data from various sources where viewers have expressed their opinions about "Squid Game."
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected text data to remove noise (like HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords) and standardize the text (lowercase conversion, tokenization, stemming or lemmatization).
