A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) : 
It is a type of artificial neural network designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. 
Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, which process each input independently, RNNs are well-suited for tasks where the order and context of inputs matter, such as time series prediction, speech recognition, natural language processing, and video analysis.

Key Characteristics of an RNN:
1.Sequential Data Handling: RNNs process input sequences one element at a time, maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous inputs. This capability allows them to model temporal dependencies in data.

2.Recurrent Connections: RNNs have recurrent connections within their architecture, enabling them to use information from previous time steps to influence the current prediction or output.

3.Memory Mechanism: The hidden state of an RNN acts as a memory that retains information about the sequence seen so far. This memory is updated and passed from one time step to the next, influencing subsequent predictions.

Types of RNNs:
1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A variant of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-range dependencies more effectively. It introduces gating mechanisms to control the flow of information in and out of the memory cell.
2. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): Another variant of RNN that simplifies the LSTM architecture by combining the forget and input gates into a single update gate, making it computationally less expensive while still addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
